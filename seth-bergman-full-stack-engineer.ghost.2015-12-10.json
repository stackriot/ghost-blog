Nice. We've put together a little post to introduce you to the Ghost editor and get you started. You can manage your content by signing in to the admin area at `<your blog URL>/ghost/`. When you arrive, you can select this post from a list on the left and see a preview of it on the right. Click the little pencil icon at the top of the preview to edit this post and read the next section!\n\n## Getting Started\n\nGhost uses something called Markdown for writing. Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!\n\nWriting in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *shortcuts* to **style** your content. For example, a list:\n\n* Item number one\n* Item number two\n    * A nested item\n* A final item\n\nor with numbers!\n\n1. Remember to buy some milk\n2. Drink the milk\n3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it\n\n### Links\n\nWant to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in url, like http://ghost.org - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org). Neat.\n\n### What about Images?\n\nImages work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:\n\n![The Ghost Logo](https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png)\n\nNot sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:\n\n![A bowl of bananas]\n\n\n### Quoting\n\nSometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it's definitely a word.\n\n> Wisdomous - it's definitely a word.\n\n### Working with Code\n\nGot a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline `<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.\n\n    .awesome-thing {\n        display: block;\n        width: 100%;\n    }\n\n### Ready for a Break? \n\nThrow 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.\n\n---\n\n### Advanced Usage\n\nThere's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can  write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very flexible.\n\n<input type=\"text\" placeholder=\"I'm an input field!\" />\n\nThat should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)","html":"<p>You're live! Nice.

I scoured the web to find the best resources available on this very interesting topic. Now you can benefit from understanding the 16 different personality types just like I have by answering  72 simple yes or no questions. If you’re wondering how 72 yes or no questions on a test could be so accurate, then you are just like I was until I took the test. Once I crossed this information there was no turning back. I have to share this knowledge with everyone. This information can break down the complexities of simple human interaction, and open your mind to a whole new way of thinking about your relationships, personal and professional.\n\nPersonality typing is a tool with many uses. It’s especially notable for it’s helpfulness in the areas of growth and self-development. Learning and applying the theories of personality type can be a powerful and rewarding experience, if it is used as a tool for discovery, rather than as a method for putting people into boxes, or as an excuse for behavior.\n\nThe sixteen personality types which we use in our assessment are based on the well-known research of Carl Jung, Katharine C. Briggs, and Isabel Briggs Myers. Carl Jung first developed the theory that individuals each had a psychological type. He believed that there were two basic kinds of “functions” which humans used in their lives: how we take in information (how we “perceive” things), and how we make decisions. He believed that within these two categories, there were two opposite ways of functioning. We can perceive information via 1) our senses, or 2) our intuition. We can make decisions based on 1) objective logic, or 2) subjective feelings. Jung believed that we all use these four functions in our lives, but that each individual uses the different functions with a varying amount of success and frequency. He believed that we could identify an order of preference for these functions within individuals. The function which someone uses most frequently is their “dominant” function. The dominant function is supported by an auxiliary (2nd) function, tertiary (3rd) function, and inferior (4th) function. He asserted that individuals either “extraverted” or “introverted” their dominant function. He felt that the dominant function was so important, that it overshadowed all of the other functions in terms of defining personality type. Therefore, Jung defined eight personality types:\n\nExtroverted Sensing (modern types: ESFP, ESTP)\nIntroverted Sensing (modern types: ISTJ, ISFJ)\nExtroverted Intuition (modern types: ENFP, ENTP)\nIntroverted Intuition (modern types: INFJ, INTJ)\nExtroverted Thinking (modern types: ESTJ, ENTJ)\nIntroverted Thinking (modern types: ISTP, INTP)\nExtroverted Feeling (modern types: ESFJ, ENFJ)\nIntroverted Feeling (modern types: INFP, ISFP)\n\nKatharine Briggs expounded upon Jung’s work, quietly working in silence and developing his theories further. But it was Katharine’s daughter Isabel who was really responsible for making the work on Personality Types visible. Isabel, using her mother’s work and Jung’s work, asserted the importance of the auxiliary function working with the dominant function in defining Personality Type. While incorporating the auxiliary function into the picture, it became apparent that there was another distinctive preference which hadn’t been defined by Jung: Judging and Perceiving.\n\nThe developed theory today is that every individual has a primary mode of operation within four categories:\nOur flow of energy\nHow we take in information\nHow we prefer to make decisions\nThe basic day-to-day lifestyle that we prefer\nWithin each of these categories, we “prefer” to be either:\n\nExtroverted or Introverted\nSensing or intuitive\nThinking or Feeling\nJudging or Perceiving\n\nWe all naturally use one mode of operation within each category more easily and more frequently than we use the other mode of operation. So, we are said to “prefer” one function over the other. The combination of our four “preferences” defines our personality type. Although everybody functions across the entire spectrum of the preferences, each individual has a natural preference which leans in one direction or the other within the four categories.\n\nOur Flow of Energy defines how we receive the essential part of our stimulation. Do we receive it from within ourselves (Introverted) or from external sources (Extroverted)? Is our dominant function focused externally or internally?\nThe topic of how we Take in Information deals with our preferred method of taking in and absorbing information. Do we trust our five senses (Sensing) to take in information, or do we rely on our instincts (intuitive)?\n\nThe third type of preference, how we prefer to Make Decisions, refers to whether we are prone to decide things based on logic and objective consideration (Thinking), or based on our personal, subjective value systems (Feeling).\nThese first three preferences were the basis of Jung’s theory of Personalty Types. Isabel Briggs Myers developed the theory of the fourth preference, which is concerned with how we deal with the external world on a Day-to-day Basis. Are we organized and purposeful, and more comfortable with scheduled, structured environments (Judging), or are we flexible and diverse, and more comfortable with open, casual environments (Perceiving)? From a theoretical perspective, we know that if our highest Extraverted function is a Decision Making function, we prefer Judging. If our highest Extraverted function is an Information Gathering function, we prefer Perceiving.\n\nPersonality Types Today\nThe theory of Personality Types, as it stand today, contends that:\nAn individual is either primarily Extraverted or Introverted\nAn individual is either primarily Sensing or iNtuitive\nAn individual is either primarily Thinking or Feeling\nAn individual is either primarily Judging or Perceiving\n\nThe possible combinations of the basic preferences form 16 different Personality Types. This does not mean that all (or even most) individuals will fall strictly into one category or another. If we learn by applying this tool that we are primarily Extraverted, that does not mean that we don’t also perform Introverted activities. We all function in all of these realms on a daily basis. As we grow and learn, most of us develop the ability to function well in realms which are not native to our basic personalities. In the trials and tribulations of life, we develop some areas of ourselves more throughly than other areas. With this in mind, it becomes clear that we cannot box individuals into prescribed formulas for behavior. However, we can identify our natural preferences, and learn about our natural strengths and weaknesses within that context.\n\nThe theory of Personality Types contends that each of us has a natural preference which falls into one category or the other in each of these four areas, and that our native Personality Type indicates how we are likely to deal with different situations that life presents, and in which environments we are most comfortable.\n\nLearning about our Personality Type helps us to understand why certain areas in life come easily to us, and others are more of a struggle. Learning about other people’s Personality Types help us to understand the most effective way to communicate with them, and how they function best.\n \nPractical Application for Personality Types\nCareer Guidance What types of tasks are we most suited to perform? Where are we naturally most happy?\nManaging Employees How can we best understand an employee’s natural capabilities, and where they will find the most satisfaction?\n\nInter-personal Relationships How can we improve our awareness of another individual’s Personality Type, and therefore increase our understanding of their reactions to situations, and know how to best communicate with them on a level which they will understand?\n\nEducation How can we develop different teaching methods to effectively educate different types of people?\nCounselling How we can help individuals understand themselves better, and become better able to deal with their strengths and weaknesses?\n\nThe Sixteen Personality Types\nThe 16 personality types were created by Isabel Briggs Myers with the assistance of her mother, Katharine Briggs, who was a student of the personality theories of Carl Jung. Briggs identified four dimensions of personality, each of which described a dichotomy between two preferred ways of being. Myers created the descriptions of each of the sixteen types, and began the research that successfully associated personality type with a wide variety of life outcomes, including career choice, lifestyle, and relationship factors.\nThe personality profiles here are based on research from a variety of sources, including the original research done by Isabel Myers.\n\nISTJ\tISFJ\tINFJ\tINTJ\nISTP\tisfp\tINFP\tINTP\nESTP\tESFP\tENFP\tENTP\nESTJ\tESFJ\tENFJ\tENTJ\n\nMy Personality Test Results\nJung Typology Test\n \nI am an INTJ.\nThis Stands for Introvert-iNtuitive-Thinker-Judger.\nIntroverts tend to be reflective, reserved and private. A popular misconception is that Introverts are shy – this is not necessarily so. They draw their energy from their own thoughts and the time they spend alone. Introverts do not need people around them all the time.\n\niNtuitives pay more attention to information that is imaginative and original. iNtuitives focus on the future.\nThinkers make decisions using logic and impersonal analysis. They think with their heads rather than their hearts.\nJudgers prefer a lifestyle that is decisive, planned and orderly. They like a life that is organized and controlled.\n\nAn INTJ at a Glance\nYou are a natural leader. You are a confident and original thinker, and believe strongly in yourself. You are a strong individualist who seeks new angles or novel ways of looking at life. In general, you are an extremely capable and intelligent individual who strives to always do their best and continue to move in a positive direction. Obstacles are challenges for you. You focus on your goal, creatively develop a plan and then pour all your energy into achieving your objective. Because you get so inspired and involved in what you are doing, your energy level can be awesome to behold! Of all the Personality Types, yours is the most independently individualistic. Inventive – inspired – persistent – creative – imaginative and determined. These are all descriptions that are likely to be used by people who know you well. INTJs have a thirst for knowledge and a passion for improvement. Constantly working to better themselves, they are often perfectionists. INTJs are also focused on finding ways to improve processes, always open to possibilities and new ideas. They enjoy taking the time to truly understand ideas or systems, and using their analytical skills to solve complex problems. INTJs often have a broad vision for what is best for an organization, and are driven to implement these ideas. Although quite creative and open to new ideas, INTJs often process information internally, sharing their inner thoughts only with those they trust. Without being able to observe the INTJs consideration of different ideas and theories, some may view their clearly stated opinions and decisive action as stubbornness. The typical INTJ, however, is always willing to consider other points of view and information and change their mind, when warranted. INTJs prefer structure and order, and expect others to follow the rules and procedures. Once committed, INTJs go to great lengths to fulfill their responsibilities and typically can be trusted to get the job done. Independent and forward-thinking, INTJs tend to be visionaries and are often found in leadership positions where they can apply their well-developed organizational skills to systems and people. Typically confident in their abilities and their insights, INTJs often have a unique ability to clearly and concisely express their vision and goals.\n\nAn INTJ at a Glance\nYou are a natural leader.

Complex operations involve many steps or stages, one following another in a necessary progression, and Masterminds are naturally able to grasp how each one leads to the next, and to prepare alternatives for difficulties that are likely to arise any step of the way. Trying to anticipate every contingency, Masterminds never set off on their current project without a Plan A firmly in mind, but they are always prepared to switch to Plan B or C or D if need be. Masterminds are rare, comprising no more than one to two percent of the population, and they are rarely encountered outside their office, factory, school, or laboratory. Although they are highly capable leaders, Masterminds are not at all eager to take command, preferring to stay in the background until others demonstrate their inability to lead. Once they take charge, however, they are thorough going pragmatists. Masterminds are certain that efficiency is indispensable in a well-run organization, and if they encounter inefficiency — any waste of human and material resources — they are quick to realign operations and reassign personnel. Masterminds do not feel bound by established rules and procedures, and traditional authority does not impress them, nor do slogans or catchwords. Only ideas that make sense to them are adopted; those that don’t, aren’t, no matter who thought of them. Remember, their aim is always maximum efficiency. In their careers, Masterminds usually rise to positions of responsibility, for they work long and hard and are dedicated in their pursuit of goals, sparing neither their own time and effort nor that of their colleagues and employees. Problem-solving is highly stimulating to Masterminds, who love responding to tangled systems that require careful sorting out. Ordinarily, they verbalize the positive and avoid comments of a negative nature; they are more interested in moving an organization forward than dwelling on mistakes of the past. Masterminds tend to be much more definite and self-confident than other Rationals, having usually developed a very strong will. Decisions come easily to them; in fact, they can hardly rest until they have things settled and decided. But before they decide anything, they must do the research. Masterminds are highly theoretical, but they insist on looking at all available data before they embrace an idea, and they are suspicious of any statement that is based on shoddy research, or that is not checked against reality.\n\nEveryone benefits from knowing his or her personality type. Once someone knows his or her type and spends some time understanding the dynamics of their personality, they quickly become more genuine, effective and efficient. When type training is implemented in work groups, teams begin working better together within weeks.\n\nKnowing your personality type brings heightened self-awareness, which has many benefits.\n \nSeveral benefits are:\nAccepting yourself and feeling good about who you are.  You will see the best aspects of yourself.   Most everyone loves their type description and is proud of who they are.\nIdentifying your natural strengths.  Everyone does best when they are working with their innate strengths.  Working in our strengths also gives us energy and enjoyment.\n\nIdentifying your natural weaknesses and blind spots.  Just like a coin, every personality type has a flip side.  If you have strengths then you also have weaknesses.  Working in our weaknesses drains us of energy and typically causes frustration.  When confronted by a situation that hits our blind spot, we typically speak and act in ways we regret.  Identifying blind spots allows us to act consciously rather than unconsciously when these situations occur.\n\nChoosing a career that is satisfying to you.  Whether it is the actual work or the work environment that means most to you, you can plant yourself where you will thrive rather than just survive.\n\nDeveloping better relationships by becoming more understanding and accepting of people who are different from you.  You can appreciate their differences when you see how their strengths and perception can help you.\nKnowing your co-workers’ personality types and those with whom you work in teams has many benefits as well.\n\nIt helps you:\nBecome a better leader and team member.  Recognizing their strengths, weaknesses, preferences, habits of mind and potential blind spots gives you the knowledge you need to make the most out of each person on the team.  It also let’s you know what work settings and styles help them become most productive and bring them enjoyment or irritation.\nImprove communication since you understand others’ points of view, concerns and comments based upon what is most important to them.\n\nResolve conflicts quickly and effectively\nMake better decisions as a team\nConduct better meetings\nManage change so that everyone is moving forward with you\nNegotiate ethical differences among employees\nBecome a better interviewer\nMatch talent to job requirements better\n\nPersonality type matters because it impacts everything we think, say and do. It impacts group dynamics and helps form the culture of organizations.  It is at the heart of good and bad relationships.  It is partially responsible for how we act in conflict, under stress and during times of change.  It impacts how we innovate, mentor, lead, manage and problem solve.  It influences time management behaviors, attentiveness in meetings, goal-setting approaches and motivation.  It even impacts the way we approach and practice spirituality.\nWhen you understand yourself better you can improve quicker and easier by addressing the right thoughts and behaviors. We all can and do act outside our personality preferences.  We are not confined to just the thoughts and behaviors of our personality type.  In fact, improvement comes by addressing both areas of natural preferences and blind spots.  Knowing your personality type gives you the insights you need to develop a personal growth plan.\n\nKnowing my personality type has helped me develop better relationships, choose my career path, develop a personal growth plan, become a better problem solver, leader, coach and trainer. All in all, I enjoy my life more since I have learned my MBTI personality type. I encourage each of you to learn your personality type and reap the many benefits at work, home and community.\n\n[Take the Jung Personality Test](http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp)","html":"<h2 id=\"personalitytypology\">Personality Typology</h2>\n\n<h5 id=\"basedoncarljungandmyersbriggs\">Based on Carl Jung and Myers Briggs</h5>\n\n<p>Your personality type is a detailed classification of the innate characteristics that make you who you are.

Myers created the descriptions of each of the sixteen types, and began the research that successfully associated personality type with a wide variety of life outcomes, including career choice, lifestyle, and relationship factors. <br />\nThe personality profiles here are based on research from a variety of sources, including the original research done by Isabel Myers.</p>\n\n<p>ISTJ    ISFJ    INFJ    INTJ <br />\nISTP    isfp    INFP    INTP <br />\nESTP    ESFP    ENFP    ENTP <br />\nESTJ    ESFJ    ENFJ    ENTJ</p>\n\n<p>My Personality Test Results <br />\nJung Typology Test</p>\n\n<p>I am an INTJ. <br />\nThis Stands for Introvert-iNtuitive-Thinker-Judger. <br />\nIntroverts tend to be reflective, reserved and private. A popular misconception is that Introverts are shy – this is not necessarily so. They draw their energy from their own thoughts and the time they spend alone. Introverts do not need people around them all the time.</p>\n\n<p>iNtuitives pay more attention to information that is imaginative and original. iNtuitives focus on the future. <br />\nThinkers make decisions using logic and impersonal analysis. They think with their heads rather than their hearts. <br />\nJudgers prefer a lifestyle that is decisive, planned and orderly. They like a life that is organized and controlled.</p>\n\n<p>An INTJ at a Glance <br />\nYou are a natural leader. You are a confident and original thinker, and believe strongly in yourself. You are a strong individualist who seeks new angles or novel ways of looking at life. In general, you are an extremely capable and intelligent individual who strives to always do their best and continue to move in a positive direction. Obstacles are challenges for you. You focus on your goal, creatively develop a plan and then pour all your energy into achieving your objective. Because you get so inspired and involved in what you are doing, your energy level can be awesome to behold! Of all the Personality Types, yours is the most independently individualistic. Inventive – inspired – persistent – creative – imaginative and determined. These are all descriptions that are likely to be used by people who know you well. INTJs have a thirst for knowledge and a passion for improvement. Constantly working to better themselves, they are often perfectionists. INTJs are also focused on finding ways to improve processes, always open to possibilities and new ideas. They enjoy taking the time to truly understand ideas or systems, and using their analytical skills to solve complex problems. INTJs often have a broad vision for what is best for an organization, and are driven to implement these ideas. Although quite creative and open to new ideas, INTJs often process information internally, sharing their inner thoughts only with those they trust. Without being able to observe the INTJs consideration of different ideas and theories, some may view their clearly stated opinions and decisive action as stubbornness. The typical INTJ, however, is always willing to consider other points of view and information and change their mind, when warranted. INTJs prefer structure and order, and expect others to follow the rules and procedures. Once committed, INTJs go to great lengths to fulfill their responsibilities and typically can be trusted to get the job done. Independent and forward-thinking, INTJs tend to be visionaries and are often found in leadership positions where they can apply their well-developed organizational skills to systems and people. Typically confident in their abilities and their insights, INTJs often have a unique ability to clearly and concisely express their vision and goals.</p>\n\n<p>An INTJ at a Glance <br />\nYou are a natural leader.

Complex operations involve many steps or stages, one following another in a necessary progression, and Masterminds are naturally able to grasp how each one leads to the next, and to prepare alternatives for difficulties that are likely to arise any step of the way. Trying to anticipate every contingency, Masterminds never set off on their current project without a Plan A firmly in mind, but they are always prepared to switch to Plan B or C or D if need be. Masterminds are rare, comprising no more than one to two percent of the population, and they are rarely encountered outside their office, factory, school, or laboratory. Although they are highly capable leaders, Masterminds are not at all eager to take command, preferring to stay in the background until others demonstrate their inability to lead. Once they take charge, however, they are thorough going pragmatists. Masterminds are certain that efficiency is indispensable in a well-run organization, and if they encounter inefficiency — any waste of human and material resources — they are quick to realign operations and reassign personnel. Masterminds do not feel bound by established rules and procedures, and traditional authority does not impress them, nor do slogans or catchwords. Only ideas that make sense to them are adopted; those that don’t, aren’t, no matter who thought of them. Remember, their aim is always maximum efficiency. In their careers, Masterminds usually rise to positions of responsibility, for they work long and hard and are dedicated in their pursuit of goals, sparing neither their own time and effort nor that of their colleagues and employees. Problem-solving is highly stimulating to Masterminds, who love responding to tangled systems that require careful sorting out. Ordinarily, they verbalize the positive and avoid comments of a negative nature; they are more interested in moving an organization forward than dwelling on mistakes of the past. Masterminds tend to be much more definite and self-confident than other Rationals, having usually developed a very strong will. Decisions come easily to them; in fact, they can hardly rest until they have things settled and decided. But before they decide anything, they must do the research. Masterminds are highly theoretical, but they insist on looking at all available data before they embrace an idea, and they are suspicious of any statement that is based on shoddy research, or that is not checked against reality.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone benefits from knowing his or her personality type. Once someone knows his or her type and spends some time understanding the dynamics of their personality, they quickly become more genuine, effective and efficient. When type training is implemented in work groups, teams begin working better together within weeks.</p>\n\n<p>Knowing your personality type brings heightened self-awareness, which has many benefits.</p>\n\n<p>Several benefits are: <br />\nAccepting yourself and feeling good about who you are.  You will see the best aspects of yourself.   Most everyone loves their type description and is proud of who they are. <br />\nIdentifying your natural strengths.  Everyone does best when they are working with their innate strengths.  Working in our strengths also gives us energy and enjoyment.</p>\n\n<p>Identifying your natural weaknesses and blind spots.  Just like a coin, every personality type has a flip side.  If you have strengths then you also have weaknesses.  Working in our weaknesses drains us of energy and typically causes frustration.  When confronted by a situation that hits our blind spot, we typically speak and act in ways we regret.  Identifying blind spots allows us to act consciously rather than unconsciously when these situations occur.</p>\n\n<p>Choosing a career that is satisfying to you.  Whether it is the actual work or the work environment that means most to you, you can plant yourself where you will thrive rather than just survive.</p>\n\n<p>Developing better relationships by becoming more understanding and accepting of people who are different from you.  You can appreciate their differences when you see how their strengths and perception can help you. <br />\nKnowing your co-workers’ personality types and those with whom you work in teams has many benefits as well.</p>\n\n<p>It helps you: <br />\nBecome a better leader and team member.  Recognizing their strengths, weaknesses, preferences, habits of mind and potential blind spots gives you the knowledge you need to make the most out of each person on the team.  It also let’s you know what work settings and styles help them become most productive and bring them enjoyment or irritation. <br />\nImprove communication since you understand others’ points of view, concerns and comments based upon what is most important to them.</p>\n\n<p>Resolve conflicts quickly and effectively <br />\nMake better decisions as a team <br />\nConduct better meetings <br />\nManage change so that everyone is moving forward with you <br />\nNegotiate ethical differences among employees <br />\nBecome a better interviewer <br />\nMatch talent to job requirements better</p>\n\n<p>Personality type matters because it impacts everything we think, say and do. It impacts group dynamics and helps form the culture of organizations.  It is at the heart of good and bad relationships.  It is partially responsible for how we act in conflict, under stress and during times of change.  It impacts how we innovate, mentor, lead, manage and problem solve.  It influences time management behaviors, attentiveness in meetings, goal-setting approaches and motivation.  It even impacts the way we approach and practice spirituality. <br />\nWhen you understand yourself better you can improve quicker and easier by addressing the right thoughts and behaviors. We all can and do act outside our personality preferences.  We are not confined to just the thoughts and behaviors of our personality type.  In fact, improvement comes by addressing both areas of natural preferences and blind spots.  Knowing your personality type gives you the insights you need to develop a personal growth plan.</p>\n\n<p>Knowing my personality type has helped me develop better relationships, choose my career path, develop a personal growth plan, become a better problem solver, leader, coach and trainer. All in all, I enjoy my life more since I have learned my MBTI personality type. I encourage each of you to learn your personality type and reap the many benefits at work, home and community.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/jtypes2.asp\">Take the Jung Personality Test</a></p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2015-09-30T19:04:05.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2015-10-01T03:18:16.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":null,"published_by":null},{"id":5,"uuid":"af380b76-cd42-4c04-8fd6-6381bbbdae0e","title":"Free SEO Audit","slug":"free-seo-audit","markdown":"\n<script src=\"//mysiteauditor.com/embed/audit-tool.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n<h2 id=\"seogroup-embed-title\">What's Your SEO Score?</h2>\n<p id=\"seogroup-embed-subtitle\">Enter the URL of any landing page or blog article and see how optimized it is for one keyword or phrase.</p>\t\t\n<div id=\"seogroup-embed\"  data-apikey=\"c7e640205cd4f84dbf120082e94bbb6de8d73b40\" data-language=\"english\" data-type=\"banner\" data-hex=\"\"></div>\n\n\n\n<style>\n#seogroup > div > p > span > a > img {\ndisplay: none !important;\n}\n</style>\n","html":"<script src=\"//mysiteauditor.com/embed/audit-tool.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>  \n\n<h2 id=\"seogroup-embed-title\">What's Your SEO Score?</h2>  \n\n<p id=\"seogroup-embed-subtitle\">Enter the URL of any landing page or blog article and see how optimized it is for one keyword or phrase.</p>  \n\n<div id=\"seogroup-embed\"  data-apikey=\"c7e640205cd4f84dbf120082e94bbb6de8d73b40\" data-language=\"english\" data-type=\"banner\" data-hex=\"\"></div>\n\n<style>  \n#seogroup > div > p > span > a > img {\ndisplay: none !important;  \n}\n</style>","image":"/content/images/2015/11/On-Page-SEO-Score-Tag-Cloud.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":"What's Your SEO Score?

We also need to tell Ghost to accept remote connections and use the port exposed by the node container (3000), since we'll be reverse proxying from the nginx container.\n\nCopy or rename the example configuration in the `ghost` subfolder.\n\n```bash\ncp ghost/config.example.js ghost/config.js\n```\n\nNext, edit `config.js` and replace the database and server configuration blocks for production with the following:\n\n```js\ndatabase: {\n  client: 'mysql',\n  connection: {\n    host: 'mariadb',\n    user: 'root',\n    password: 'my-password',\n    database: 'ghost'\n  },\n  debug: false\n},\nserver: {\n  host: '0.0.0.0',\n  port: '3000'\n}\n```\n\nNotice that the hostname we've used for our database connection is `mariadb`, we will use this when setting up the link between our MariaDB and node containers. We also specify a password and database, which we will pass as environment variables to the MariaDB container.\n\n# Creating an nginx virtual host\n\nThe next step is to create a virtual host for the nginx container to reverse proxy to our node container. The nginx container contains some example configurations, we will use and modify the node app example.\n\n### Step 1: Copy and save the virtual host configuration\n\nCreate a subfolder in your project directory for the nginx configuration called `nginx-vhost`.\n\n```bash\nmkdir nginx-vhost\n```\n\nCopy and save the text below into `nginx-vhost/ghost.conf`.\n\n```nginx\nserver {\n    listen 0.0.0.0:80;\n    server_name my-ghost-blog.com;\n\n    location / {\n        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n        proxy_set_header HOST $http_host;\n        proxy_set_header X-NginX-Proxy true;\n\n        proxy_pass http://ghost:3000;\n        proxy_redirect off;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe hostname we are proxying to is `ghost`, which we also use when setting up the link between our nginx and node containers.\n\n# Using Docker Compose\n\nThe easiest way to get up and running is using <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/compose/\" target=\"_blank\">Docker Compose</a>. It uses one YAML file to define the different containers your application will use, the way they are configured as well as the links between different containers.\n\n### Step 1: Install Docker Compose\n\nFollow this guide for installing Docker Compose.\n\n#### <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/\" target=\"_blank\">Install Docker Compose</a>\n\n### Step 2: Copy Docker Compose definition\n\nCopy the definition below and save it as `docker-compose.yml` in your project directory.\n\n```less\nmariadb:\n  image: bitnami/mariadb\n  environment:\n    - MARIADB_DATABASE=ghost\n    - MARIADB_PASSWORD=my-password\n\nghost:\n  image: bitnami/node\n  links:\n    - mariadb:mariadb\n  volumes:\n    - ghost:/app\n  command: \"sh -c 'npm install --production && npm start --production'\"\n\nnginx:\n  image: bitnami/nginx\n  links:\n    - ghost:ghost\n  ports:\n    - 80:80\n  volumes:\n    - nginx-vhost:/bitnami/nginx/conf/vhosts\n```\n\nIn this Docker Compose definition, we used the `volumes` property to mount the Ghost app and our nginx virtual host.\n\n`MARIADB_DATABASE` and `MARIADB_PASSWORD` are environment variables that the MariaDB image takes to setup a database and password for the root user on first run. We used the same credentials we defined in the [Ghost config.js file](#step-2-configure-ghosts-database-credentials).\n\nUsing the `links` property, we defined links between node and MariaDB, and nginx and node. We used the same hostnames we used earlier when setting up the\n[database credentials](#step-2-configure-ghosts-database-credentials) and\n[nginx virtual host](#step-1-copy-and-save-the-virtual-host-configuration).\n\nFinally, we expose port 80 for nginx to port 80 on the host, allowing us to access Ghost from the host machine.\n\n### Step 3: Running Docker Compose\n\nIt's really easy to start a Docker Compose app.\n\n```bash\ndocker-compose up\n```\n\nDocker Compose will show log output from all the containers in your application.\n\n### Step 4: Access your Ghost instance\n\nTo access the `server_name` we set up in our virtual host, you may need to create an entry in your `/etc/hosts` file to point `my-ghost-blog.com` to localhost.\n\n```bash\necho '127.0.0.1 my-ghost-blog.com' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts\n```\n\nNow that everything is up and running, navigate to <a href=\"http://my-ghost-blog.com/ghost\" target=\"_blank\">http://my-ghost-blog.com/ghost</a> or in your browser to access your new Ghost instance!\n\n<style>  \n#home {\ndisplay: none !important  \n}\n</style> \n ","html":"<h1 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h1>\n\n<p>In this tutorial, we will use Bitnami containers to run the <a href=\"https://ghost.org\" target=\"_blank\">Ghost blogging platform</a>, taking advantage of Docker features such as linking and volumes.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ahrefhttpsgithubcombitnamibitnamidockernodetarget_blanknodea\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-node\" target=\"_blank\">node</a></h3>\n\n<p>Since Ghost is a node.js application, we will use the node container to run it.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ahrefhttpsgithubcombitnamibitnamidockermariadbtarget_blankmariadba\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-mariadb\" target=\"_blank\">MariaDB</a></h3>\n\n<p>We will link node to a MariaDB container for Ghost to use as it's data store.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ahrefhttpsgithubcombitnamibitnamidockernginxtarget_blanknginxa\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-nginx\" target=\"_blank\">nginx</a></h3>\n\n<p>We will serve our Ghost app through an nginx server which we will make accessible to the host machine. nginx will act as a reverse proxy to our node container that will run the Ghost server.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"settingupghost\">Setting up Ghost</h1>\n\n<h3 id=\"step1downloadghost\">Step 1: Download Ghost</h3>\n\n<p>Create an new project directory that will contain our app's content.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">mkdir docker-ghost  \ncd docker-ghost  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The latest version of Ghost can be downloaded from GitHub <a href=\"https://ghost.org/download\" target=\"_blank\">https://ghost.org/download</a>. <br />\nDownload and save the archive in your project directory using your browser, or command line.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">curl -LO https://ghost.org/zip/ghost-0.6.4.zip  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Next, unzip the archive into a subfolder named <code>ghost</code> in your project directory.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">unzip ghost-0.6.4.zip -d ghost  \n</code></pre>\n\n<h3 id=\"step2configureghostsdatabasecredentials\">Step 2: Configure Ghost's database credentials</h3>\n\n<p>By default Ghost is setup to use a local sqlite database, since we are using MariaDB, we need to change the configuration.

Please follow the instructions below to use them.\n\nRunning Ubuntu Cloud Guest on Amazon Web Services requires you to go through the following steps:\n\nCreate your account on Amazon (if you do not already have one) and setup your credentials\nInstall Amazon EC2 API Tools\nInstantiate your images(s)\nConfigure your instance\nTypes of credentials\nFirst, a note on the area of EC2 that most often confuses people: credentials. There are multiple different kinds of credential, Amazon uses slightly non-standard nomenclature, and it's not always clear which credential is required for a given application.\n\nSignon credentials: These are the email address/password pair that you use when you sign up. You use these to sign on to the AWS console, and can be considered the \"master\" credentials as they allow you to regenerate all other types of credentials.\n\nAccess Credentials: There are three types: access keys, X.509 certificates and key pairs. The first and second type allow you to connect to the Amazon APIs. Which type of credential depends on which API and tool you are using. Some APIs and tools support both options, whereas others support just one. The third type is SSH public/private key pairs that are used for initial logins to newly created instances.\n\naccess keys: Symmetric key encryption. These are for making requests to AWS product REST or Query APIs. Can be obtained/regenerated from the Access Keys tab on the AWS Security Credentials page.\n\nX.509 certificates: Public key encryption. Use X.509 certificates to make secure SOAP protocol requests to AWS service APIs. These are the credentials you will use when using the command-line ec2 api tools. Can be obtained/regenerated from the X.509 Certificates tab on the AWS Security Credentials page.\n\nkey pairs: SSH key pairs. When you create an instance, Amazon inserts the public key of your SSH key pair into your new instance so that you can log in using your private key. You can add new SSH key pairs through the AWS management console by clicking on Key Pairs under Networking and Security in the Navigation pane and then the Create Key Pair button. After specifying a name you will be prompted to download and save your private key. EC2 stores the public portion of your key pair, and inserts it into /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys when you instantiate your instance. If you lose this private key, it cannot be downloaded again; you will need to regenerate a new key pair.\n\n\nSetting up an Amazon account\nYou can associate your new EC2 account with an existing Amazon account (if you already have one), or create a new account.\n\nGo to http://aws.amazon.com, and select Sign-up Now. Sign in to your existing Amazon account or create a new one.\n\nGo to http://aws.amazon.com/ec2, and select \"Sign Up for Amazon EC2\".\n\nEnter your credit card information.\nComplete your signup for the Amazon EC2 service.\nAfter signing up, you should end up at the EC2 console\n\nCreate a key pair and download the private key\nClick Key Pairs under Networking and Security in the Navigation pane and then click the Create Key Pair button (save it in e.g. ~/.ec2/ec2.pem). This private key is for making SSH connections to newly created instances.\nYou will also need to set up your Amazon API credentials. Go to Account->Security Credentials\n\nclick X.509 Certificates tab\nCreate a new Certificate\nDownload the private key and the certificate (save them in e.g. ~/.ec2/cert-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.pem and ~/.ec2/pk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.pem).\nMake your credential files private: chmod go-rwx ~/.ec2/*.pem \nScroll to the bottom of the page and note your account ID (a number of the form XXXX-XXXX-XXXX).\nIf at a later time you discover you need to generate a new X.509 certificate, click on \"Your Account\" at the top of the EC2 console page. You may need to click the small button with two down arrows near the top right of the EC2 console page to make the \"Your Account\" link visible. Then in the \"Access Credentials\" box, click the tab named \"X.509 Certificates\" and click \"Create a New Certificate\". Download the private key and certificate when prompted.\n\nOfficial Ubuntu Cloud Guest Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)\nThe Official AMI Ids can be obtained from http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/. Official Ubuntu AMIs are published by the 'Canonical' user, with Amazon ID '099720109477'. Images containing the string 'ubuntu' but not owned by that ID are not official AMIs.\n\nRelease images can be found at http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases/, for example 14.04 LTS Trusty Tahr can be found under http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases/14.04/release/\n\nMake sure you have multiverse enabled and run the following command:\n\nsudo apt-get install ec2-api-tools\nIf you're not on the latest ubuntu release the packages may be a bit old. You can make use of the awstools ppa by doing:\n\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:awstools-dev/awstools\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install ec2-api-tools\nMake sure you have the following environment variables set up in your shell profile. This is accomplished by adding the following lines to your ~/.bashrc if you use bash as your shell:\n\nexport EC2_KEYPAIR=<your keypair name> # name only, not the file name\nexport EC2_URL=https://ec2.<your ec2 region>.amazonaws.com\nexport EC2_PRIVATE_KEY=$HOME/<where your private key is>/pk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.pem\nexport EC2_CERT=$HOME/<where your certificate is>/cert-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.pem\nexport JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/\nNotes:\nSee Common Options for API Tools for a description of what these environment variables do.\n\nThe EC2_KEYPAIR is the Key Pair Name as listed in the AWS Management Console under Networking and Security -> Key Pairs, not the filename of the private key file that you saved to your local machine. This variable tells ec2 which SSH public key to insert into the instance during instantiation.\n\nThe ec2 regions at the time of writing were:\n\nRegion\n\nURL\n\nUS-East (Northern Virginia)\n\nec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\nUS-West (Northern California)\n\nec2.us-west-1.amazonaws.com\nEU (Ireland)\n\nec2.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com\nAsia Pacific (Singapore)\n\nec2.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com\nAsia Pacific (Sydney)\n\nec2.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com\nAsia Pacific (Tokyo)\n\nec2.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com\nLoad the changes into the current shell environment:\nsource ~/.bashrc\nCheck to see if it's working by running the following command:\nec2-describe-images -o self -o amazon\nNote: If this fails due to \"Client.AuthFailure\" then ensure you have signed up for both AWS and ec2 with amazon.com, and have provided valid payment details. Also double check that the EC2_PRIVATE_KEY and EC2_CERT point to the correct locations.\n\nEC2 security groups\nSecurity groups allow you to specify firewalling rules for your instances. These firewalling rules are independent of, and in addition to, the software firewalling provided by the instance's operating system (iptables in the case of modern Ubuntu systems). Security groups must be defined before you create the instances that you would like to be members of those security groups. You specify the security groups to add an instance to at creation time with the -g option to the ec2-run-instances command. You cannot add an existing instance to a security group.\n\nHow you set up your security groups is up to you. You may choose to set up security groups that correspond to server functions, or have a separate security group for each instance. An instance may be a member of multiple security groups. If you don't specify any security groups when you instantiate an instance, it will be added to the default security group. Our examples use the default security group, but keep in mind that this means that this causes an inability to set up firewalling rules in a granular fashion.\n\nIf you wish to create a more complex security group configuration, you can do so with these commands:\n\n ec2-add-group <group name> -d <description>\n ec2-delete-group <group name>\n ec2-describe-group [<group name> ...]\nSee the Using Security Groups section of the User Guide for Amazon EC2 for more information.\n\nInstantiating an image\nThe images and kernel are public, so they do not require any registration. To start an instance, we use a command of the following form:\n\nec2-run-instances ami-xxxxx -k ${EC2_KEYPAIR} -t <instance type>\nwhere\n-t is instance type you wish to instantiate\n\nami-xxxxx is the AMI ID of the particular AMI you wish to instantiate that corresponds to your chosen instance type (from the lists of Ubuntu AMIs on http://uec-images.ubuntu.com/).

Please follow the instructions below to use them.</p>\n\n<p>Running Ubuntu Cloud Guest on Amazon Web Services requires you to go through the following steps:</p>\n\n<p>Create your account on Amazon (if you do not already have one) and setup your credentials <br />\nInstall Amazon EC2 API Tools <br />\nInstantiate your images(s) <br />\nConfigure your instance <br />\nTypes of credentials <br />\nFirst, a note on the area of EC2 that most often confuses people: credentials. There are multiple different kinds of credential, Amazon uses slightly non-standard nomenclature, and it's not always clear which credential is required for a given application.</p>\n\n<p>Signon credentials: These are the email address/password pair that you use when you sign up. You use these to sign on to the AWS console, and can be considered the \"master\" credentials as they allow you to regenerate all other types of credentials.</p>\n\n<p>Access Credentials: There are three types: access keys, X.509 certificates and key pairs. The first and second type allow you to connect to the Amazon APIs. Which type of credential depends on which API and tool you are using. Some APIs and tools support both options, whereas others support just one. The third type is SSH public/private key pairs that are used for initial logins to newly created instances.</p>\n\n<p>access keys: Symmetric key encryption. These are for making requests to AWS product REST or Query APIs. Can be obtained/regenerated from the Access Keys tab on the AWS Security Credentials page.</p>\n\n<p>X.509 certificates: Public key encryption. Use X.509 certificates to make secure SOAP protocol requests to AWS service APIs. These are the credentials you will use when using the command-line ec2 api tools. Can be obtained/regenerated from the X.509 Certificates tab on the AWS Security Credentials page.</p>\n\n<p>key pairs: SSH key pairs. When you create an instance, Amazon inserts the public key of your SSH key pair into your new instance so that you can log in using your private key. You can add new SSH key pairs through the AWS management console by clicking on Key Pairs under Networking and Security in the Navigation pane and then the Create Key Pair button. After specifying a name you will be prompted to download and save your private key. EC2 stores the public portion of your key pair, and inserts it into /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys when you instantiate your instance. If you lose this private key, it cannot be downloaded again; you will need to regenerate a new key pair.</p>\n\n<p>Setting up an Amazon account <br />\nYou can associate your new EC2 account with an existing Amazon account (if you already have one), or create a new account.</p>\n\n<p>Go to <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com\">http://aws.amazon.com</a>, and select Sign-up Now. Sign in to your existing Amazon account or create a new one.</p>\n\n<p>Go to <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2\">http://aws.amazon.com/ec2</a>, and select \"Sign Up for Amazon EC2\".</p>\n\n<p>Enter your credit card information. <br />\nComplete your signup for the Amazon EC2 service. <br />\nAfter signing up, you should end up at the EC2 console</p>\n\n<p>Create a key pair and download the private key <br />\nClick Key Pairs under Networking and Security in the Navigation pane and then click the Create Key Pair button (save it in e.g. ~/.ec2/ec2.pem). This private key is for making SSH connections to newly created instances. <br />\nYou will also need to set up your Amazon API credentials. Go to Account->Security Credentials</p>\n\n<p>click X.509 Certificates tab <br />\nCreate a new Certificate <br />\nDownload the private key and the certificate (save them in e.g. ~/.ec2/cert-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.pem and ~/.ec2/pk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.pem). <br />\nMake your credential files private: chmod go-rwx ~/.ec2/*.pem <br />\nScroll to the bottom of the page and note your account ID (a number of the form XXXX-XXXX-XXXX). <br />\nIf at a later time you discover you need to generate a new X.509 certificate, click on \"Your Account\" at the top of the EC2 console page. You may need to click the small button with two down arrows near the top right of the EC2 console page to make the \"Your Account\" link visible. Then in the \"Access Credentials\" box, click the tab named \"X.509 Certificates\" and click \"Create a New Certificate\". Download the private key and certificate when prompted.</p>\n\n<p>Official Ubuntu Cloud Guest Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) <br />\nThe Official AMI Ids can be obtained from <a href=\"http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/\">http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/</a>. Official Ubuntu AMIs are published by the 'Canonical' user, with Amazon ID '099720109477'. Images containing the string 'ubuntu' but not owned by that ID are not official AMIs.</p>\n\n<p>Release images can be found at <a href=\"http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases/\">http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases/</a>, for example 14.04 LTS Trusty Tahr can be found under <a href=\"http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases/14.04/release/\">http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases/14.04/release/</a></p>\n\n<p>Make sure you have multiverse enabled and run the following command:</p>\n\n<p>sudo apt-get install ec2-api-tools <br />\nIf you're not on the latest ubuntu release the packages may be a bit old. You can make use of the awstools ppa by doing:</p>\n\n<p>sudo apt-add-repository ppa:awstools-dev/awstools <br />\nsudo apt-get update <br />\nsudo apt-get install ec2-api-tools <br />\nMake sure you have the following environment variables set up in your shell profile. This is accomplished by adding the following lines to your ~/.bashrc if you use bash as your shell:</p>\n\n<p>export EC2<em>KEYPAIR=<your keypair name> # name only, not the file name <br />\nexport EC2</em>URL=<a href=\"https://ec2\">https://ec2</a>.<your ec2 region>.amazonaws.com <br />\nexport EC2<em>PRIVATE</em>KEY=$HOME/<where your private key is>/pk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.pem <br />\nexport EC2<em>CERT=$HOME/<where your certificate is>/cert-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.pem <br />\nexport JAVA</em>HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/ <br />\nNotes: <br />\nSee Common Options for API Tools for a description of what these environment variables do.</p>\n\n<p>The EC2_KEYPAIR is the Key Pair Name as listed in the AWS Management Console under Networking and Security -> Key Pairs, not the filename of the private key file that you saved to your local machine. This variable tells ec2 which SSH public key to insert into the instance during instantiation.</p>\n\n<p>The ec2 regions at the time of writing were:</p>\n\n<p>Region</p>\n\n<p>URL</p>\n\n<p>US-East (Northern Virginia)</p>\n\n<p>ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com <br />\nUS-West (Northern California)</p>\n\n<p>ec2.us-west-1.amazonaws.com <br />\nEU (Ireland)</p>\n\n<p>ec2.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com <br />\nAsia Pacific (Singapore)</p>\n\n<p>ec2.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com <br />\nAsia Pacific (Sydney)</p>\n\n<p>ec2.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com <br />\nAsia Pacific (Tokyo)</p>\n\n<p>ec2.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com <br />\nLoad the changes into the current shell environment: <br />\nsource ~/.bashrc <br />\nCheck to see if it's working by running the following command: <br />\nec2-describe-images -o self -o amazon <br />\nNote: If this fails due to \"Client.AuthFailure\" then ensure you have signed up for both AWS and ec2 with amazon.com, and have provided valid payment details. Also double check that the EC2<em>PRIVATE</em>KEY and EC2_CERT point to the correct locations.</p>\n\n<p>EC2 security groups <br />\nSecurity groups allow you to specify firewalling rules for your instances. These firewalling rules are independent of, and in addition to, the software firewalling provided by the instance's operating system (iptables in the case of modern Ubuntu systems). Security groups must be defined before you create the instances that you would like to be members of those security groups. You specify the security groups to add an instance to at creation time with the -g option to the ec2-run-instances command. You cannot add an existing instance to a security group.</p>\n\n<p>How you set up your security groups is up to you. You may choose to set up security groups that correspond to server functions, or have a separate security group for each instance. An instance may be a member of multiple security groups. If you don't specify any security groups when you instantiate an instance, it will be added to the default security group. Our examples use the default security group, but keep in mind that this means that this causes an inability to set up firewalling rules in a granular fashion.</p>\n\n<p>If you wish to create a more complex security group configuration, you can do so with these commands:</p>\n\n<p>ec2-add-group <group name> -d <description>\n ec2-delete-group <group name>\n ec2-describe-group [<group name> ...]\nSee the Using Security Groups section of the User Guide for Amazon EC2 for more information.</p>\n\n<p>Instantiating an image <br />\nThe images and kernel are public, so they do not require any registration. To start an instance, we use a command of the following form:</p>\n\n<p>ec2-run-instances ami-xxxxx -k ${EC2_KEYPAIR} -t <instance type> <br />\nwhere <br />\n-t is instance type you wish to instantiate</p>\n\n<p>ami-xxxxx is the AMI ID of the particular AMI you wish to instantiate that corresponds to your chosen instance type (from the lists of Ubuntu AMIs on <a href=\"http://uec-images.ubuntu.com/\">http://uec-images.ubuntu.com/</a>). See Amazon EC2 Instance Types or Instance Families and Types for descriptions of the available instance types, and Amazon EC2 Pricing for the current pricing of instances, data transfer and storage.</p>\n\n<p>To see the status of your instance, you can run the following command:</p>\n\n<p>ec2-describe-instances <br />\nIn order to log in to your instance, you will need to authorize network access to the ssh port for the default security group:</p>\n\n<p>ec2-authorize default -p 22 <br />\nYou may then log in to the instance using ssh:</p>\n\n<p>ssh -i <private SSH key file> ubuntu@<external-host-name> <br />\nThe <private SSH key file> is the filename of the private SSH key that corresponds to the Amazon Key Pair that you specified in the ec2-run-instances command. The <external-host-name> can be found using the ec2-describe-instances command. An example SSH command:</p>\n\n<p>ssh -i ~/.ec2/ec2.pem ubuntu@ec2-135-28-52-91.compute-1.amazonaws.com <br />\nOnce you have logged in, you may begin to set up and use the instance just like any other Ubuntu machine.</p>\n\n<p>You will be billed as long the host is running1, so you will probably want to shut it down when you're done. Note that each partial instance-hour consumed will be billed as a full hour.</p>\n\n<p>ec2-terminate-instances <instance_id> <br />\nv</p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"draft","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2015-11-17T13:59:46.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2015-11-17T14:00:32.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":null,"published_by":null},{"id":12,"uuid":"4aa29052-caca-4ae8-800c-86b6e512d084","title":"Chef and Puppet - Cloud Configuration Automation","slug":"chef-and-puppet-configurations-cloud-config","markdown":"\n## Cloud config examples\n\n###`Source:`\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/sethbergman/b5cd7acfb6151a75efe3.js\"></script>\n\n#### Configure an instances resolv.conf\n\n>**Note** when using a config drive and a RHEL like system `resolv.conf` will also be managed 'automatically' due to the available information provided for dns servers in the config drive network format.
